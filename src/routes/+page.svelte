<p>Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Marty Neal, and I'm a Software Engineer living in Vancouver WA.

<p>This website is a platform where I can share my knowledge and experiences with the world. When I'm not working, I love to spend time with my wife and two kids.

<p>My hobbies include playing piano, video games, chess. I also love to learn new things, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow as a person.

<p>Below are some of my projects I've been working on

<ul>
    <li>My daughter is very passionate about helping others all around the world. Check out the site she is building all by herself <a href="/save-world">here</a></li>
    <li>My thesis work involved finite state transducers which you can read about <a href="fst">here</a>
</ul>
